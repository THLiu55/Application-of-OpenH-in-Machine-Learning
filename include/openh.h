/*
 * OpenH is a novel programming model and library API for 
 * developing portable parallel programs on heterogeneous 
 * hybrid servers composed of a multicore CPU and one or 
 * more different types of accelerators. 
 *
 * OpenH integrates Pthreads, OpenMP, and OpenACC seamlessly 
 * to facilitate the development of hybrid parallel programs. 
 * An OpenH hybrid parallel program starts as a single main 
 * thread, which then creates a group of Pthreads called 
 * hosting Pthreads. A hosting Pthread then leads the 
 * execution of a software component of the program, which 
 * is either an OpenMP multithreaded component running on 
 * the CPU cores or an OpenACC (or OpenMP) component running 
 * on one of the accelerators of the server. The OpenH library 
 * provides API functions that allow programmers to get the 
 * configuration of the executing environment and bind the 
 * hosting Pthreads (and hence the execution of components) 
 * of the program to the CPU cores of the hybrid server 
 * to get the best performance.
 *
 * The API is described in the following article:
 * OpenH: A Novel Programming Model and API for 
 * Developing Portable Parallel Programs on Heterogeneous Hybrid Servers
